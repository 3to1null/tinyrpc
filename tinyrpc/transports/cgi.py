    The CGIServerTransport adds CGI as a supported server protocol that can be used

    waiting.  The transport accepts only POST requests.

    A POST request provides the entire JSON-RPC request in the body of the HTTP
    request.

    With this version support for GET requests is dropped as recommended by
    http://www.simple-is-better.org/json-rpc/transport_http.html.
